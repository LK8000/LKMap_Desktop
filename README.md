# LKMap_Desktop

The LK8000 Tactical Flight Computer requirs elevation and map data files for each area that you wish to fly in.

LKMaps Desktop has been written to create the two data files required quickly and efficiently. See the HELP file available from within the software for a full explaination.

To install, download the zipped file from https://github.com/LK8000/LKMap_Desktop/releases and extract it to a folder of your choice, then run the executable file LKMaps Desktop.exe.

LKMaps Desktop has been significantly rewritten to enhance its performance and to squish some coding issues that clashed with changes to the Digital Elevation Model and Open Street Map data download processes.

The software now utilises the Open Source utility Osmconvert, which improves speed and may correct any download data errors. 

The GDAL Utilities are also the latest available, which has further enhanced performance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO TONINO TARSI:-

Sincere acknowledgement must be given at the start of this documentation to Tonino Tarsi for the incredible amount of work he put into developing LKMaps Desktop. My contribution has been to update a small part of the code to solve a few issues that have crept in over time as the Digital Terrain Model access method and OpenStreetMaps data processing requirements changed.
